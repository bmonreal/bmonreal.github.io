<h1>Nuclear, particle, and astrophysics acronym graph</h1>
Is your experiment in this graph?  (<a href=http://www.project8.org>Project 8</a> is not!  It's not an acronym! There are too many acronyms. Many of them are terrible.)

Download <a href=plaintext_soln.svg>this SVG</a> or <a href=plaintext_soln.pdf>this PDF</a> to print (at around 36"x36") or buy it at <a href =https://www.zazzle.com/the_acronyms_of_every_physics_experiment_graphed_poster-228473563497200675>my zazzle store</a>.

Footnote: I had this data and code on hand for a <a href=puzzle.html>puzzle</a> but I thought it'd be interesting to see in this form.  I excluded (a) completely disconnected nodes ("Experience pour DEtecter Les Wimps En Site Souterrain") less strictly (b) less-acronymic things dominated by intact words (KamiokaNDE, MicroBooNe, MeerKAT) (c) things I couldn't find documentation of the name's meaning (LIBRA? TASSO?), (d) things that technically have acronyms but where everyone uses a different name, like people seem to say "Allen array" rather than "ATA", and (e) things too far from my own professional knowledge but not famous enough to have a Wikipedia page (you could probably make a graph this large just out of nuclear structure instruments but I had to stop at GRETINA)
