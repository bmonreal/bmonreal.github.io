<h1>Common English Research Nomenclature: Solution</h1>

As hinted by the title "CERN"---which was once an acronym (Conseil europeen pour la recherche nucleaire) but is no longer considered one---you have been given a large directed graph showing the words used in the acronymic names of large physics experiments and facilities.  From well-formed acronyms (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider = RHIC) to nested ones (Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC = STAR) to tortured ones (ZonEd Proportional scintillation in LIquid Noble gases = ZEPLIN, for God's sake) to tortured and nested ones (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS = ATLAS, seriously), work through the grid and fill in the acroynms.  There's a node for every word that contributes to every acronym.  Words used only once (like "Solenoidal") are filled in, except for the letter actually used in the acroynm.  Unused words ("scintillation" for ZEPLIN) are omitted. Hyphens are treated as word breaks (e.g. we present LIGO as "Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory", leaving "wave" as unused and omitted).
<p>
The acrostic-letter-labels supplied by the experiment acroynms will fill in the 2nd set of graphs with fragments of names like "?achazo" or "?irac".  Now you're into the world of particle physics theories, which also bear acronymic names (Britto Cachazo Feng Witten recursion = BCFW recursion).   Exactly as in the experiments graph, names that contribute to multiple acronyms are left blank and must be deduced; you will fill in all-but-the-first-letter of other names.  When you've named the theorists, and named the theories, you'll find the low-numbered acrostic blanks filled in.  Transfer them to the answer acrostic to get the final cluephrase:  PHD ADVISOR OF PHYSICIST THAT COINED TERM LASER.  It's <i>another</i> physics acronym!  "LASER" was coined by Gordon Gould---who had an early concept and patent application but not Schlalow/Townes/Maiman's experimental successes---and whose Columbia doctoral advisor was (a) CWRU alum and (b) later Nobel laureate (c) not a Pokemon, and (d) the actual answer to this puzzle, POLYKARP KUSCH.
