  	      At day 55, SN 1987A is still brightening in visible light. Did you notice that it stopped getting redder? (That's why I am tweeting B-mags, people! For this!)  It's time to add some NEW PHYSICS.  What sets the supernova's brightness?  Thread: 1/7

  	      Actually the *very* early bright spike---the first days, when IUE saw all that UV---the supernova was bright because it was SUPER HOT.  You saw the shock-heating of the photosphere by the pressure wave coming out from the core collapse.  After that ... 2/7

  	      it returned quickly to its equilibrium temperature---or whatever its equilibrium temperature would have been without that shock input---and then just got bigger and bigger. Expanding against the pull of gravity cooled it, but ... huge surface area = bright. 3/7

  	      But the "surface" isn't always there! Ionized hydrogen is opaque, great at emitting and absorbing light. NEUTRAL hydrogen is not---it's transparent!  As the photosphere cools, the outer layers are recombining! 4/7

  	      The hydrogen that was ionized/visible/photosphere-y on Feb 28 is now invisible---it's a transparent hydrogen atmosphere that you are looking THROUGH to see the NEW photosphere.  The new photosphere is some deeper gas that's still hot enough to be ionized. 5/7

  	      So the 1987A hydrogen is still expanding, but the *ionized* volume isn't quite keeping up---a "recombination wave" is starting to creep inwards and neutralize (and transparent-ify) an atmosphere around it.  You're seeing FRESH hot gas you have not seen before. 6/7
