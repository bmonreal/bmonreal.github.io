  <h1>Giant Physics Acronym Posters</h1>
There are three versions of my Giant Physics Acronyms Puzzle.  Download and print your own, or buy one print-on-demand from <a href=https://www.zazzle.com/bmonreal_puzzle>my zazzle store</a>.
<ul>
 <li> <a href=giant_poster_puzzle.html>A giant two-poster acrostic</a> with a mystery graph and a cluephrase
  <li> <a href=small_poster_puzzle.html>A single-poster puzzle</a> to fill in (but without a variety-puzzle like extraction, and not actually testsolved)
  <li> <a href=acronyms.html>The same acronym dataset</a> as an attractive poster but not a puzzle as such.
  </ul>

<h1>Mystery Hunt puzzles with science content</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href=http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/first_you_visit_burkina_faso.html>(2019) First You Visit Burkina Faso</a> was concieved as a "geography konundrum"---not a puzzle requiring an aha, per se, but a set of 20 geographical directions which require some technical GIS skills to follow.

<li><a href=http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/small_steps.html>(2019) Small Steps </a> with Greg Pliska and Tom Buehler.  Includes an MIT runaround component, so not necessarily solvable online, but includes (if I may speak vaguely and avoid spoilers) content relevant to my professional interests.
 <li><A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2017/puzzle/crackpot_or_snackpot.html" title="r1005">(2017) Crackpot or Snackpot?</A> of particular interest to particle physicists
<li><A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2017/puzzle/a_beauty_cold_and_austere.html" title="r0802">(2017) A Beauty Cold and Austere</A> math content, of particular interest to MIT alums
<li><A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2017/puzzle/general_aviation.html" title="r1103">(2017) General Aviation</A> (some science content sort of)
<li><A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2017/puzzle/dispatches_from_the_foreign_service_units.html" title="r1405">Dispatches from the Foreign Service Units</A> (some CS content)
</ul>
<h1>Non-science puzzles</h1>
<ul>
  <li><A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2017/puzzle/fruitless.html" title="r0508">(2017) Fruitless</A> the fastest-to-solve puzzle in the 2017 Hunt and a good thing to look at if you've never seen a variety puzzle before.
  
<li><a href=http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/problem/holi_patriots_day.html>(2019) The Holi/Patriot's Day Metapuzzle </a> 

  
<li><a href=http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/a_bunch_of_ripoffs.html>(2019) A Bunch Of Ripoffs</a> was a mystery-novel-themed puzzle written with Sarah Bagby.  There's a basic "what's going on here" aha that leads you to a second data collection step which, I sincerely hope, led at least some solvers to call their parents to help with data collection.

<li><a href=http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/circulatory_system.html>(2019) Circulatory System</a> is a little lark of a puzzle, but I have a special fondness for it because the first step is substantially accessible to a five-year-old without being trivial for a grownup. 

<li><a href=http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/concrete.html>(2019) Concrete</a> is a bunch of pentominos which, when assembled, should be aesthetically pleasing.  The puzzle is mine but the aesthetically pleasing assemblies are variously by me, Sarah Bagby, and Gail West, and Sarah's father Richard Bagby helped with pentomino constraints. 

<li><a href=http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/delightful.html>(2019) Delightful</a> 

<li><a href=http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/have_you_seen_me.html>(2019) Have You Seen Me?</a> by me and Sarah Bagby is a wordsearch with a hole in the middle.  There's something hiding in the hole.  Wait, no, it's four identical wordsearches, what's going on? 

<li><a href=http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/puzzle/ipod_submarine.html>(2019) Ipod Submarine</a> was a fun collaborative brainstorm of me, Sarah Bagby, Vera Tobin, and Steve Cook.
