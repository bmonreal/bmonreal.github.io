  <h2>Neutrinos</h2>
Deep geological bodies of solid salt are common in North America and Europe.  WIPP, Boulby, and the IMB site are in abundant "bedded" salt deposits.  Tall, pure "domal" salt sites are common on the US Gulf Coast, northern Germany, and the Persian Gulf.  Note that the edge of the "Pine Salt" formation is 1.5Â° off-axis from the DUNE neutrino beam, and salt beds underlay many nuclear reactor sites. 
  <p>
  The natural-gas industry routinely creates large, stable high-pressure caverns in salt via <b>solution mining</b>. Solution-mined caverns are made from the surface by pumping in fresh water and extracting brine; the cavern shape is managed by manipulating a cover gas. The process is far cheaper ($20/m3) than conventional lab excavation ($1000/m3) and volumes to 2x10</sup>6</sup> m3 are possible.  Our hope is to piggyback on this cheap, existing technology by designing detectors that can deploy remotely via the otherwise-conventional 12"-24" well pipe.
<p>
Salt caverns' vast sizes and high pressures give us a unique path to ton- or kiloton- scale gas TPCs.
High-pressure TPCs are a well-known detector medium, with longer tracks and better calorimetry than liquids.  However, detectors like NEXT, NEWS-G, and HPgTPC are constrained to small target masses because they need heavy, expensive pressure vessels.
Salt caverns have nearly-unlimited pressurized space.  We can make use of it under a challenging constraint: can the detector be engineered to squeeze down a 24" well?   

<h2>A kiloton-scale CNO neutrino experiment in neon</h2>
<ul>
<li>  10 m diameter x 80 m tall inflated cathode balloon cylinder
<li>Cylindrical drift under 100-200 kV voltage
<li>50 cm segmented anode cylinder.  Conventional multiwire gain grid.
<li>Target: 500 t neon at 100 bar (77 kg/m3)
<li>Shielding/veto: >15 m of Ar-based gas mixtures
</ul>

This 500 t (Borexino-like) scale allows very sensitive solar neutrino spectroscopy; here we have nearly 7000 CNO events above the 7Be edge (and 300 above the pep edge) suggesting 1-2% precision on a rate measurement.  Background issues require further study.

Background-reducing considerations:
<ul><li>Electron tracks are 10-20 cm long; cut on sun direction
<li>TPC resolves gamma ray interactions as multisite Compton scattering
<li>Dissolved (?) beta emitters (214Bi, etc.) often have a displaced gamma
<li>Cosmogenic 11C production is low on 20Ne target
<li>The major pp-neutrino background 14C is absent
  </ul>

<h2>Dark matter</h2>
 At volumes large enough to self-shiel, salt-compatible inflatable high-pressure gas TPCs may be excellent dark matter detectors.  We described some possible enabling tecnologies in: <b>Sub-Penning gas mixtures: new possibilities for ton- to kiloton-scale time projection chambers</b><p> (<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04926>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04926</a>) by Benjamin Monreal, Luiz de Viveiros, William Luszczak.

<h2>Proton decay</h2>
  The largest salt caverns, at volumes around 2x10<sup>6</sup>m, are far larger than the largest practical excavated rock caverns.  Both cavern engineering and excavation cost severely constrain the size of experiments like HyperKamiokande.  We are investigating whether a water-filled salt cavern could host a post-HyperK proton decay water Cerenkov experiment.
    
<h2>Case Underground Salt Observatory</h2>
  The Salina salt beds lie 600m beneath the Case campus.  We are proposing to develop the salt-cavern underground lab methods, and deploy unique large TPCs, in this formation, via a well drilled on or near campus.  We are actively proposal-writing on this topic.  Contact me if you would like to participate in any way.
