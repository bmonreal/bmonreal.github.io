<h1>Common English Research Nomenclature</h1>
    <div class="puzzle-content">
      Is your experiment in this graph?  (<a href=http://www.project8.org>Project 8</a> is not!  It's not an acronym! There are too many acronyms. Many of them are terrible.)
      <p> You can also use this graph as a puzzle!  In <a href=small_poster_puzzle.html>the smaller version</a>, I've left all the acronyms blank for you to figure out---as well as all of the words that get used more than onces.  You'll have to work your way in from the edges!.   In <a href=giant_poster_puzzle.html>the giant version</a>,  as you solve the experiment-acronym graph, you can fill in an acrostic on <i>another</i> mysterious graph, which in turn lets you figure out a cluephrase.  
<p>
Footnote: I had this data and code on hand for a <a href=puzzle.html>puzzle</a> but I thought it'd be interesting to see in this form.  I excluded (a) completely disconnected nodes ("Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe") (b) acronymic uses of non-alphabetic characters (K0TO, T2K, MINER&nu;A) and less formally (c) 
      things that are barely acronyms (XMASS) (d) things I couldn't find documentation of the name's meaning (LIBRA? TASSO?) and (e) things that technically have acronyms but where everyone uses a different name (my sense is that people say "Allen array" rather than "ATA").  Nonexistent (defunct, cancelled, proposed) projects and projects not famous enough to have Wikipedia pages are included irregularly.
