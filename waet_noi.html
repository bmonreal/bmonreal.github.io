<h1>Wide Aperture Exoplanet Telescope Astro2020 notice-of-intent</h1>
Each of the ELT-class telescopes under construction in the 2020s carries a price tag above $1B.  Although these are on the low end of costs once extrapolated from fitting power laws to historical telescope budgets, but do not leave the field with an encouraging path forward.  The ELTs do not have the resolution and planet-imaging power of an OWL-class telescope, and at the same time they are not really testbeds for technologies that might be affordable at OWL scale in the future.
<p>
In 2018 we proposed a telescope mount/configuration called WAET (Wide Aperture Exoplanet Telescope) which aimed to use familiar technologies in a configuration with an intrinsically favorable cost scaling law.  WAET telescopes have a very long, narrow filled aperture, with one axis stretched (say 100--300m) for high-resolution science, and the other axis only wide enough (say, 2--6m) for adequate light collection.  This aperture shape is particularly well suited for exoplanet direct imaging and spectroscopy, since separating a planet from its host starlight is essentially a one-dimensional problem, and systems are sufficiently often aligned with the telescope's one good axis.
<p>

Rather than having an alt-az mount of the whole telescope structure, WAET has a one-degree-of-freedom tiltable siderostat placed in front of the one-degree-of-freedom sliding primary---the optical equivalent to the Kraus-type radio telescope, but with more capable pointing.  Our paper showed that these mounts are intrinsically low-cost and scaleable, leading to observatories dominated by the costs of primary mirror cells.  Moreover, the design is intended to have low technical risk and can utilize familiar optical design, segmentation plans, cophasing, etc.; indeed most mirror/mount engineering issues appear far easier than the corresponding problems in alt-az mounts.  The familiar/already-solved nature of most of WAET's components allows us to make early cost estimates with some confidence.  For example, applying Keck-like primary mirror costs to 100 m x 2 m instrument (called "hWAET") yields a $155M construction cost estimate; a riskier design---using OWL-based cost estimates for a spherical primary---reaches 300 m x 5 m ("kWAET") at a cost of only $280M.  
<p>

In contrast to the 20-year design and construction lifetime of EELTs, we argue that discovery-ready WAET telescopes at the 100~m scale can be realized quickly, both due to the funding profile and the engineering simplifications.  In this whitepaper, we will review the general concept for WAET-mounted telescopes; suggest three specific examples for possible implementation, and estimate the science reach of each; and review what we see as the key sources of design, performance, and cost uncertainty.  We will suggest followup design studies which could answer these questions in the early 2020s and permit us to begin constructing 100+ meter telescopes before 2030.
