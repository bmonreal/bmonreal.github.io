Daily life on Earth revolves around three physical laws---electromagnetism (governing atoms and light), gravity (keeping stars and planets together), and strong forces (making nuclei together).  The Universe may be full of relics from a time when <i>weak interactions</i> were equally important; though these relics are hard to detect, they may have much to teach us about the nature of matter and the history of the cosmos.

I am an experimentalist who tries to interact with weakly-interacting particles using a broad array of techniques.  With Joe Formaggio, I pioneered "cyclotron radiation electron spectroscopy", an atomic-physics-inspired method of measuring nuclear beta decay, which we are working to build into "Project 8", a large tritium decay experiment which will search for the mass of the neutrino.   With many American and European collaborators, I work on the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment (KATRIN) which expects to collect its first tritium decay data (and obtain new neutrino-mass sensitivity) in 2017.  I also work on new methods for building giant next-generation detectors for dark matter, neutrinoless double beta decay, proton decay, and neutrinos.
